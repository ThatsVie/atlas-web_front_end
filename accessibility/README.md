### Task 0: Make the "Works" Card Focus Visible
The goal of this task is to ensure that the focus state of the "Works" cards is visually apparent when navigating using the keyboard in the desktop version of the webpage.



**To test these changes:**

- Open `01-index.html` in your web browser.
- Use the TAB key to navigate through the links on the page.
- Verify that the "Works" card titles become visible with a dark background on focus, similar to the hover effect.

**Before:**

In the initial implementation (`00-index.html`), the focus on the "Works" cards is not visually apparent when navigating using the TAB key.
