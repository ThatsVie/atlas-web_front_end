## Tasks

### Task 0: Capturing the Website on iPhone X

This task involved using the device toolbar in Developer Tools to emulate an iPhone X screen size and take a screenshot of the website. This helps demonstrate the site's responsive design capabilities and ensures that it looks appropriate on mobile devices.

**Steps:**

Opened the website in a browser and accessed Developer Tools.

Switched to device emulation mode and selected iPhone X as the target device.

Captured a screenshot showing the site as rendered on an iPhone X screen.

Took a screenshot named `0-responsive_device.png`, providing a visual reference of the website's mobile responsiveness.

### Task 1: Changing the Background Color

In this task, the background color of the entire website was changed to #4233bd. This task demonstrates how Developer Tools can be used to modify the appearance of a website in real-time for testing and development purposes.

**Steps:**

Accessed the Developer Tools and selected the `<body>` tag.

Modified the CSS directly within the Developer Tools to change the background color.

Navigated to the "PORTFOLIO" section and took a screenshot to capture the change.

Took a screenshot named `1-change_bg_color.png`, documenting the new background color as it appears in the "PORTFOLIO" section.

### Task 2: Forcing the Hover State

This task focused on demonstrating the ability to manipulate element states through Developer Tools. Specifically, the hover state of the "cake" block in the "Portfolio" section was forced, and a screenshot was taken to capture this state.

**Steps:**

Used Developer Tools to select the "cake" block.

Forced the hover state using the state simulation options in the Styles pane.

Took a  screenshot while the hover state was active.

Took a screenshot named 2-pathways_menu.png while the hover state was active, showing the visual effects applied to the "cake" block when hovered over. This is useful for visual testing and ensuring interactive elements respond as expected without interacting with the site through user input.
